Hey there! I recently finished my PhD in Neuroscience under Prof. João Peça at University of Coimbra and am now in search for new opportunities outside strict academia.
I am incredibdly passionate about science and how it can drive positive change. 
Detail-oriented and capable of managing mutidisciplinary teams. Extemely fast learner and proactive.
Experienced in multi-language programming as well as data analysis and visualization in the
context of life sciences. Passionate about developing tools to improve research.
Tech enthusiast and tinkerer. 

Here you can find some of the illustrations I created throughout my PhD, either for research and review articles or SciComm activities!
